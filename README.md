# 🧩 React Assignment — Tabs & Gallery Widgets

This project is a **frontend assignment** built with **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on component structure, responsiveness, and pixel-perfect UI replication based on a given Figma design.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application replicates a right-side dashboard layout featuring two main widgets:

1. **Tabs Widget** — includes three interactive tabs:  
   - “About Me”  
   - “Experiences”  
   - “Recommended”  
   Each tab dynamically updates its content and includes a smooth sliding indicator effect.

2. **Gallery Widget** — displays a scrollable image gallery with hover animations and an “Add Image” feature allowing users to upload local images dynamically.
